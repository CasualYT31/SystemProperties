# SystemProperties
Cross-platform C++ library used to retrieve hardware and software information.

# Goals
The goal of this project is to program an interface via which a program may query the computer for various hardware and software details, such as CPU, memory, storage, GPU, etc. The library must be cross-platform and must be easily integratable into other projects via CMake. I intend to use command line tools in order to carry out reliable queries. This may have an impact on the efficiency of the library, but it should make it robust and extensible.
